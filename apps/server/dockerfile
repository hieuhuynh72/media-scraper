# Step 1: Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

# Step 2: Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Step 3: Copy package files
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./

# Step 4: Install dependencies using pnpm
RUN npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && npm i -g pm2 

# Step 5: Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Step 6: Build the application
RUN pnpm build

# Step 7: Remove dev dependencies for production
RUN pnpm prune --prod

# Step 8: Use a lightweight runtime image for production
FROM node:18-alpine AS runtime

# Step 9: Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Step 10: Copy built files and production dependencies from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/package.json ./package.json

# Step 11: Set environment variables
ENV PORT=4000

# Step 12: Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 4000

# Step 13: Define the command to run the application
CMD ["node", "dist/main.js"]
